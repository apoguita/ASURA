//! The auth service: the program the game talks to when it logs in.
//!
//! Owns: the login endpoint (key exchange, login, character list), sessions, and telling the client
//! which world to join. Does NOT own placement, character state, instances, or the gameplay
//! connection — those belong to the world servers (`docs/01-scope.md`).
//!
//! AzerothCore parallel: their `authserver` — realmlist, session key, and nothing else.
//!
//! The connection follows the order `docs/03-protocol.md` records, and each step is a module in
//! `asura-protocol`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. first four bytes      client::version      what kind of connection is this
//! 2. the version message   client::version      plaintext, 16 bytes
//! 3. the key exchange      client::handshake    two plaintext seeds, then everything is scrambled
//! 4. frames                client::frame        header plus a body the header's size fixes
//! 5. login                 client::messages + asura-db::login
//! ```
//!
//! Two behaviours worth stating, because they are rules from the reference and not preferences:
//!
//! * **A connection that is not understood is closed, not guessed at.** GWPS logs the bytes and drops
//!   the socket; `VersionError::Unknown` does the same here.
//! * **A login that does not resolve is answered with the client's auth error**, in a request
//!   response, rather than by silence or by a drop: the client shows an error it can describe, and
//!   the session stays closed (`asura_db::login::find_session` returns `None`).
