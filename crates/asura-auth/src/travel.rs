//! Travel: answering `AUTH_CMSG_REQUEST_GAME_INSTANCE` with a world the client can actually reach.
//!
//! The client asks for a map; the auth service answers with `AUTH_SMSG_GAME_SERVER_INFO` — an address,
//! a map token, and a player token — and then the ordinary `AUTH_SMSG_REQUEST_RESPONSE` with status 0.
//! That pair is the whole contract: the reference sends the info message and the response, and nothing
//! else (`AuthSrv_HandleRequestGameInstance`).
//!
//! Five steps, in this order, and the order is the design:
//!
//! 1. **Decode** the request. Six dwords; a body that does not hold them is a malformed message, not a
//!    guess.
//! 2. **Find candidate worlds** that publish the requested map, are not draining, said they were alive
//!    recently, and whose counter says there is room (`asura_db::placement::find_worlds`).
//! 3. **Probe the port.** A world can be fresh in the database and dead on the socket. The one rule
//!    this service must never break is that it does not hand a client an address nothing is listening
//!    on: the client's next move is a connection, and its failure mode is a loading screen that never
//!    ends. So every candidate is dialled, cheaply, before it is offered.
//! 4. **Reserve** the slot. Only the database can decide there is room (`reserve` is one atomic
//!    statement); the counter read in step 2 is a hint, and losing the race simply means trying the
//!    next candidate.
//! 5. **Answer**: the game server info, then the request response. Both, in that order, because the
//!    client waits for the response and the info message alone is not an answer.
//!
//! A refusal is `AUTH_SMSG_REQUEST_RESPONSE` with `GM_ERROR_NETWORK_ERROR` (2) and no info message.
//! That is honest — the client shows an error it can describe — and it is what the previous milestone
//! did for *every* travel request. What is new is that a refusal is now the exception.
