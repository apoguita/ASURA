//! Chat: spoken lines, and the command table they arrive through.
//!
//! The reference has no chat handler; it prints and answers into its own log
//! (`docs/HANDOFF.md`). This module is that half, plus the `!`/`#`/`$` channel rule and the
//! `/maps`, `/stuck` and `/tp` command table ([`Command`], [`command`]) a player types into a
//! chat line. The travel `/tp` starts lives in `travel.rs`; this module only decides which
//! command a line names.

/// The reference's `/maps`, line for line (`GmCommand_ListTargets`).
///
/// It prints two things and they are **not the same text**, which is the part I had wrong until a client
/// tester pointed out that the list no longer showed every map:
///
/// * the **chat** side is one alias per map -- the first in the table, because that is the one to type --
///   comma-separated and wrapped inside one chat fragment, then the reference's fixed
///   "`Use: /tp <name>, e.g. /tp lakeside county`";
/// * the **log** side is **every alias**, one row each, with the map it names, in the reference's own column
///   widths and in its table order:
///
/// ```text
/// Teleport targets (20 aliases, every one with a map config):
///   /tp ascalon          -> map 148  Ascalon City (pre-Searing)
///   /tp ascalon city     -> map 148  Ascalon City (pre-Searing)
/// ```
///
/// The header's count is the **alias** count, not the map count, and the loop below prints a row per alias:
/// collapsing it to one row per map (which is what the chat half does) is how `/maps` stopped naming the
/// aliases a tester has to type.
///
/// The table is what a person reads, and it is the half that has always worked: no chat text has ever
/// reached a client's screen, in the reference or here, and GWPS's own chat gate leaves the chat half in its
/// log with the rest. So this returns the log lines, in that format, and `/maps` prints them. The chat
/// fragments are built too, because they are the answer's other half and a caller may one day have a channel
/// that renders them -- but `/maps` does not send them: sending chat crashed a live client here.
///
/// Only the aliases of maps **this world hosts** are listed, so a narrowed `--maps` does not advertise a
/// target `/tp` would refuse. With the default (the whole catalogue) that is the reference's whole table.
/// A map the reference's table does not name gets one row of its own, named by its id, rather than vanishing.
