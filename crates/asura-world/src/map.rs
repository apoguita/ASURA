//! The map: a catalogue entry, its path graph, and the blocks that carry it to a client.
//!
//! [`Map`] is the noun and [`MapEntry`] is what a world publishes and what `/maps` lists;
//! [`PathGraphs`] is the imported `Gw.dat` geometry a
//! `MOVE_TO_COORD` is answered from (the reference's `srv->map_context`); [`spawn_block`],
//! [`load_block`] and [`manifest`] are the map's side of the instance load.

//! A live instance is **not** here yet: today the map a connection is in is a `MapEntry` on its
