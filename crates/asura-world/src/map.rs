//! The instance load: the blocks that carry a map to a client.
//!
//! [`spawn_block`] and [`load_block`] are the map's side of the instance load, and [`manifest`] is the
//! three-phase handshake that precedes it. The catalogue entry they take is
//! [`crate::catalogue::MapEntry`]; the graphs a walk is answered from are `crate::pathfind`.
//!
//! A live instance is **not** here yet: today the map a connection is in is a `MapEntry` on its
//! `Player` record (`connection.rs`). The instance object is the missing noun, recorded in
//! `docs/work/session-handoff.md` and deferred with the simulation (`docs/reference/decisions/0003-simulation-scope.md`).
