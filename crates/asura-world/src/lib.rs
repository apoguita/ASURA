//! The world server's gameplay connection.
//!
//! A world server is where a client plays. The auth service tells a travelling client *where* to
//! connect (`AUTH_SMSG_GAME_SERVER_INFO`); this module is what answers when it does.
//!
//! The order, and it is the reference's order (`docs/reference/client-protocol.md` section 11):
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. classify          the first four bytes name the connection kind; anything but a game
//!                      connection is refused here, not guessed at
//! 2. GAME_CMSG_VERSION 64 bytes: the world id, map, player token, account and character
//! 3. claim             the token pair must match a transfer this world was told about, or the
//!                      connection is closed (the reference closes it with no message at all)
//! 4. key exchange      the client's seed, the server's seed; everything after is scrambled
//! 5. the load block    four messages, sent without being asked: INSTANCE_LOAD_HEAD,
//!                      PLAYER_DATA_START, LOAD_PLAYER_NAME, LOAD_INFO
//! 6. the three asks    the client asks for items, for a spawn point, and for the players; each is
//!                      answered, and the last answer ends with INSTANCE_LOAD_FINISH
//! 7. keep-alive        a world tick every 500 ms and a ping every 5 s, forever
//! ```
//!
//! What exists today, and what does not -- `docs/history/gwps-parity/handler-status.md` holds the hand-kept answer; its
//! generator was retired when parity closed (`docs/history/service-supervisor-delivery-plan.md`):
//!
//! * the character the transfer named, standing where the map's spawn says - or where it stood when it
//!   last left, which is saved and read back (`asura_db::game::record_position`);
//! * the other players in the same instance: each newcomer is introduced to the ones already there
//!   and told when one leaves (`instance.rs`, `PeerView` and `introduction`);
//! * the character's inventory, read from rows and built into the reference's messages, including the
//!   nine items `UPDATE_AGENT_VISUAL_EQUIPMENT` puts on the model (`asura_db::inventory`);
//! * `GAME_CMSG_DROP_ITEM`, which deducts the stack and sends nothing: the reference's own handler is
//!   unfinished and the ground agent crashed a live client (`item.rs:243-249`);
//! * no NPCs, no combat, no quests, no picking anything up.
//!
//! The load messages go out even for the parts that are not simulated, because a client that does not
//! receive them never leaves the loading screen.
