//! The dispatch table: one header in, one domain's handler out.
//!
//! The reference's `GameSrv.c` is one switch over headers and so is this; a client cannot be told
//! about a command seam it does not speak. What this file is *not*: a home for domain logic. Each
//! arm validates, then calls into `item`, `chat`, `travel`, `creation`, `player` or `map`; the
//! only state it touches is the one the message is about.
//!
//! A header with no arm is framed and ignored - named in the trace, never guessed at.
