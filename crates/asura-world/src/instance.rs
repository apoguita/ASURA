//! The instance: one hosted map, running.
//!
//! `docs/02-architecture.md` "Inside a world server": a map is updated by one owner, its state needs
//! no locking across tasks, and the update threads have map affinity. This is that owner - the
//! object a `MapEntry` describes, and the thing a `Player` stands in.
//!
//! It holds who is in the map, the agent each one drives, and the clock. The tick is the reference's
//! `GameSrv_WorldTick`: announce the elapsed time to every client, advance every agent along its
//! walk, and broadcast a crossed waypoint to everyone in the instance. One clock per map, as the
//! reference has one loop for the whole server.
