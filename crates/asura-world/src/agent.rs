//! One agent's position, and the rules the reference uses to believe a client about it.
//!
//! A client moves itself: it walks where it wants and reports its position about twice a second
//! (`GAME_CMSG_POSITION_UPDATE`), and it can ask to stop (`CANCEL_MOVEMENT`) or to correct where it was
//! when a move was cancelled. The server's job is to keep its own idea of where the agent is, and to
//! refuse the parts of that which cannot be true.
//!
//! The rules are the reference's (`GmAgent.c`, `GameSrv_HandlePositionUpdate` and friends), and they are
//! copied rather than invented because they are what a real client's movement is shaped for:
//!
//! * with 50 units of slack, a client may be as far ahead as its own speed allows since the last report,
//!   and no further. Between two reports 2 seconds apart at 288 units a second that is a generous
//!   budget; a report after a five-minute stall is not a teleport, it is a client that resumed;
//! * an out-of-budget report is not dropped. The agent is moved as far along the reported direction as
//!   the budget allows - dropping it leaves the two views further apart than accepting part of it;
//! * a plane change is allowed only when it is short (stairs, a small portal);
//! * a correction after a cancelled move is accepted only within 100 units and only on the same plane.
//!
//! ## Walking
//!
//! The other half is the server's own idea of a walk, and it is the reference's too: a `MOVE_TO_COORD`
//! becomes a path (`pathfind.rs`, from `GmPaths.c`), the agent walks the first segment at its own
//! `speed_base` (288 units a second, `GameSrv.c:1088`), and every world tick moves it `speed_base * delta`
//! further along. When a segment ends the next waypoint becomes the destination and the world is told;
//! when the last one ends the walk is over and the agent stands still. That state is [`Motion`], which is
//! the reference's `GmAgent.destination`, `.direction`, `.speed`, `.waypoints` and `.waypoint_idx`.
