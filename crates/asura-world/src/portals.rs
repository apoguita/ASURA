//! The travel portals of each instance, read only from the selected pack's portals.json files.
//!
//! A map's doorways are content, one file per map folder (`config/World/<pack>/maps/.../<map
//! id>/portals.json`, `docs/38-layer-decisions.md` D39): an **arch** is a wall the character crosses,
//! stated as its two endpoints and the map it leads to; an **arrival** states where a character
//! arriving in this map **from** a named map stands, and which way it faces. The target map owns its
//! arrivals, so the map that receives a traveller decides where that traveller lands.
//!
//! The file shape, as the owner wrote it (2026-11-05):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "map_id": 148,
//!   "arches":   [ { "idx": 0, "to_map": 146, "from_x": 7550.0, "from_y": 55123.0,
//!                   "to_x": 7060.0, "to_y": 5621.0 } ],
//!   "arrivals": [ { "from": 146, "x": 7755.18, "y": 5887.82, "angle": 0.57 } ] }
//! ```
//!
//! A point-shaped arch (`x`/`y` and no `from_x`/`from_y`) is the older shape the archive and the
//! database carry: it has no wall, so a step counts as crossing it when it intersects a box edge at [`point_half_extent`] of
//! the point. A wall-shaped arch counts a crossing only when the step passes through the segment, which
//! is the owner's rule: "the portal is an invisible wall we cross ... should be a plane".
//!
//! **Two facts a reader must keep in mind.** Several instances share one geometry blob, so the same portal
//! coordinates appear under 146, 148 and 164 alike: a position says where a doorway is, not which instance
//! the character is in. And `to_instance` is filled only where a crossing was measured, because the
//! destination belongs to the zone - so a row with none must not fire.
