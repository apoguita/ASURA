//! The exploration grid a character's map surfaces draw from.
//!
//! The client keeps one bit per 32-unit cell, **per continent**, and it has no source for those
//! dimensions except the server: `GAME_SMSG_MAP_INIT_START` (`0x008B`) announces
//! `{dims.x, dims.y, compressed byte count}`, the `GAME_SMSG_CARTOGRAPHY_DATA` (`0x008A`) messages
//! that follow carry the compressed bits, and the client decompresses once it has the announced
//! number of bytes. It asserts `dims.x % 32 == 0` on the way in, and its map view asserts the grid
//! against the continent's own map art the first time a player opens a map
//! (`Assertion: worldMapDims.x == mapDims.x * DXT_BLOCK_SIZE`, client build 39112,
//! `GmMapView.cpp(1731)`, measured 2026-10-29 - the assertion this module answers).
//!
//! The compressed form is the client's own, and it is a band format rather than a general
//! compressor: the grid is cut into bands of 16 scanlines, each band is a `u16` byte length followed
//! by a two-state run-length encoding, and runs alternate polarity starting with **zeros**
//! (unexplored). A run's length is the sum of consecutive `0xFF` bytes up to and including the first
//! byte that is not `0xFF`, and every run after the first is one longer than its bytes say.
//!
//! **A band with no runs needs no bytes at all**: its length is `0` and the client fills the band
//! with unexplored cells (`CharCli` zeroes the grid before it decodes and stops a band when its
//! bytes end). A live client's own message shows exactly that shape - eleven empty bands beside one
//! full one (`recordings/client/feature/character_creation/character_creation-live-necro_factions.jsonl`,
//! seq 1055/1056).
//!
//! What this module sends today is a grid with **nothing explored**: every band is empty, so the
//! whole blob is `dims.y / 16` pairs of zero bytes. The bits are a character's progress and this
//! schema keeps none, so "nothing" is the honest value and it is also what a fresh character has.
