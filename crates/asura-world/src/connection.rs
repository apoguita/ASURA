//! One gameplay connection: hello, load, gameplay, goodbye.
//!
//! The server's `ConnectedClient`, and [`run`], which owns it. A socket is
//! classified, its key exchange is completed, the token pair is claimed against a transfer, the
//! load block goes out unasked, and then [`run`] owns the socket: the world tick, the ping, the
//! client's messages (through `dispatch.rs`) and the broadcasts other players push at it.
//!
//! The player record (`player.rs`) is what a connection drives, and it is where the character, the
//! inventory, the agents and the instance they are in currently live. That is the shape the
//! `Instance` object would replace: the map state belongs to the map, not to the socket. Recorded,
