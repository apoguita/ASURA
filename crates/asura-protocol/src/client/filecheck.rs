//! The file check: a fixed 21-byte question and a fixed 32-byte answer, on the auth port.
//!
//! This is not a message with a header in the table — it is a bare request that arrives **before** the
//! version message, in the reference's `ConnState_AwaitHello` state
//! (`AuthSrv_TryHandleFileCheck` in GWPS `AuthSrv.c`). The client compares the reply against what it
//! expects; the reference answers and then keeps waiting, because "the client repeats the check, and
//! anything that follows it is a normal handshake".
//!
//! Both byte strings below are copied verbatim from that function, including the comment's meaning:
//! the six ids in the reply are `Gw.dat` file ids in tight consecutive order with a zero among them,
//! which is a check of *which* files the client should have, not a transfer.
//!
//! Refusing this request costs the whole login, which is why it is here: a service that classifies the
//! first four bytes as an unknown connection type — as this one did before the check existed — closes a
//! socket the client is waiting on, and the client sits at "Connecting" with nothing to report.

/// The request, exactly as the reference compares it (`memcmp` against all 21 bytes).
