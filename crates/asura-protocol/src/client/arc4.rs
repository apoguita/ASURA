//! ARC4, the stream cipher the client protocol scrambles everything with after the key exchange.
//!
//! **This is a port, not a design.** Source: GWPS `arc4.c` (30 lines: `arc4_setup`, `arc4_crypt`,
//! `arc4_crypt_inplace`), which is textbook RC4 — the key schedule and the byte generator below are
//! the standard ones, and the known-answer tests pin that down against published vectors rather than
//! against my reading of the C.
//!
//! RC4 is broken as a cipher, and nobody should use it for anything new. It is here because the
//! client speaks it and there is no negotiating: `docs/03-protocol.md` section 3. That also means a
//! *crate* would not help — the requirement is byte-exactness with one specific implementation, and
//! the honest way to get that is to write the 20 lines and test them (`docs/adr/0009-crypto-
//! primitives.md`).
//!
//! Two instances per connection, one per direction, keyed identically: GWPS copies the encryption
//! context into the decryption one (`cipher_dec = cipher_enc` in `AuthSrv_DoPostHandshake`). They are
//! independent *states*, so each direction has its own keystream offset — which is why [`Arc4`] is
//! `Clone` and why the handshake clones rather than shares.

/// The RC4 keystream state: a 256-byte permutation and two indices.

/// The C version keeps `x` and `y` as `int` and masks on every use; here they are `u8`, and the
/// masking is implicit. The arithmetic is identical, because every use in the reference applies
/// `& 0xFF` to a value that is already reduced.
