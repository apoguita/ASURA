//! Message framing: a `u16` header and a fixed-size body that the header alone implies.
//!
//! **There is no length field.** This was verified in the reference rather than assumed:
//! `pack_msg` (`msgpack.c`) writes the format's fields and nothing else, and
//! `AuthConnection_SendMessage` sends exactly `sizeof(struct)` bytes of them, so the size of an
//! auth message is a property of its header via [`tables`] and is never transmitted. GWPS's receive
//! path reads the header, looks the format up, and lets `unpack_msg` consume the fields
//! (`AuthSrv.c`, `AuthSrv_GetMessages`).
//!
//! `docs/03-protocol.md` section 1 described a `u16 length` here. That was wrong, and it is the
//! kind of wrong that costs a session: a port that writes a length the client does not expect gets
//! nothing back but error `007`. The document now records the correction and the evidence for it.
//!
//! Consequences that shape this module:
//!
//! * **Decoding cannot see a wrong size**, because no size is on the wire. The risks are a header
//!   that is not in the table (refused, never guessed) and a body that is still arriving
//!   ([`FrameError::Incomplete`], which is a signal to read more, not a violation).
//! * **Encoding can.** [`Frame::encode_validated`] is the second half of the port's safety: a body
//!   built at the wrong size is indistinguishable from a working one until the client reports
//!   `007`, so it is refused here instead.
//! * **Buffering lives elsewhere.** [`Frame::decode`] takes bytes and returns a frame plus how many
//!   it used; the socket owner keeps the buffer.
