//! Game rules, as decisions the server makes before a world exists.
//!
//! This crate exists because the auth service was answering a game question
//! (`docs/38-layer-decisions.md`, D25). Login has to say *where* a character enters the game, but
//! "where does a character start" is a rule of the game, not of the protocol, so it lives here and
//! both services can call it.
//!
//! Every function here is pure: the caller reads the rows, hands them in, and gets a decision back.
//! Nothing in this crate opens a connection, reads a file or prints. That is what keeps it callable
//! from the auth service, from the world, and from a test with no database.
//!
//! The rules are the owner's, recorded in `docs/22-world-model.md` ("Spawn points, and the outpost
//! rule") and `docs/38-layer-decisions.md` (D18, D19, D34).
//!
//! It holds decisions and no values. A number that describes the world - where a character enters, how
//! old a world's heartbeat may be - is configuration (`config/Server/`), handed in as an argument; the
//! numbers a client defines, like its map kinds, are the wire layer's (D34).

///    mistaken question that follows a creation confirm. The answer is the character's own row, then
///    its last outpost, then [`fallback_outpost`] - never map 0, which has no map file and leaves the
///    client on a loading screen.
/// 3. Any other destination that is not a main town is replaced by the last outpost, because entering
///    the game puts the character in the last outpost it visited; with no last outpost, again the
///    fallback.
///
/// `kinds` is what the client calls a town, an explorable area and the creation instance, read from
/// `config/Server/defaults.json`. It arrives as an argument for the same reason the other two values
/// do: this crate holds no value of its own.
///
/// `creation_map` is the creation instance's map id, from `config/Server/defaults.json`
/// (`docs/38-layer-decisions.md`, D34): the one destination that is a conversation rather than a
/// place, and the value a row carries when nothing has been written. It arrives as an argument for
/// the same reason the fallback outpost does - this crate holds no value of its own.
///
/// `fallback_outpost` is where a character with no placement history is put. It is configuration - one
/// number in `config/Server/placement.json` - and it arrives as an argument, because the outpost a
/// character enters is written by character creation, by a scripted event and by travelling, never by
/// a rule. This function holds no value of its own (`docs/38-layer-decisions.md`, D34).
///
/// `destination_type` is the map type of the map being asked for, as the caller read it, or `None`
/// when the map is not in the catalogue - an unknown map is left alone for the caller to refuse.
