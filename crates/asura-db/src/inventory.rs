//! The inventory: a character's bags and the items in them.
//!
//! Until this module existed the world server answered the client's item request with the reference's
//! own messages, replayed byte for byte (`asura_protocol::game::default_inventory`). That made a client
//! happy and made the server know nothing: there was no row, bag or slot to name, so nothing could be
//! dropped, equipped, moved or saved. These are the rows that replaced them, and the two operations the
//! world server needs them for:
//!
//! * **reading** a character's inventory into the shape the wire wants ([`load`]);
//! * **creating** the default inventory for a character that has none ([`seed_default`]), which is what
//!   the reference does for every player it creates (`GameSrv_CreateDefaultBags`, guarded by
//!   `IsValidBag` so a loaded character keeps what it had);
//! * **finding** the item a client asks to drop ([`find_in_carrying_bags`]), restricted to the bags the
//!   reference searches (`GmBag_FindItem` looks only at the backpack, the belt pouch and bags 1 and 2).
//!
//! The model, and where it differs from the reference's own `items`/`bags` tables, is argued in
//! `crates/asura-db/migrations/0006_inventory.sql`. In one line: a bag is named by the id the client is
//! told *and* by its kind, an item's name and modifiers are stored because `CREATE_NAMED_ITEM` carries
//! them, and a bag's own item is a row with no slot rather than a struct compiled into the server.
