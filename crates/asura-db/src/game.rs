//! The reads a world server needs: which map blob to load, where to spawn, and who the character is.
//!
//! Small on purpose. A world server owns the gameplay connection and its own in-memory simulation;
//! what it takes from the database is the handful of facts a client cannot be told without, and what
//! it writes back arrives with the milestone that writes state (`docs/roadmap.md`, M5).
//!
//! Two of those facts are a character's position, and this is where it is read and written: the world
//! saves it when a player leaves and starts from it when the player comes back. **The reference does not
//! do this** - it re-spawns every character at its map's spawn point on every session, and keeps only
//! the map a character was last in (`characters.last_outpost`). ASURA keeps the coordinate because the
//! whole of placement exists to answer "who is where", and a player who logs back in where it logged out
//! is the smallest thing that answer is worth. The seed leaves the column NULL, so a character that has
//! never been played still spawns where the map says.
