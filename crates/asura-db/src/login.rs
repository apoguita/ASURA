//! Login: turning the pair the client presents into an account, and reading what it may see.
//!
//! The client sends two UUIDs — a portal user id and a session id — and gets either a character list
//! or an error. That is the whole transaction, and this module is the only place it is decided.
//!
//! AzerothCore parallel: their `LoginDatabase` statement for the auth account, and the character-list
//! read that follows a successful login. The shape is theirs; the vendor is PostgreSQL
//! (docs/adr/0008-database-vendor.md).
//!
//! GWPS is the reference for the *rules*, and both of them are easy to get subtly wrong
//! (`docs/03-protocol.md` section 4):
//!
//! * **The pair is validated, never half-trusted.** `Db_GetSession(user_id, session_id)` looks up one
//!   row matching both. A right portal user with a wrong session id is not "close enough".
//! * **A closed session is never honoured.** `docs/05-gw2-lessons.md` rule 1: the newest session for
//!   an account wins and older ones are closed. A closed row therefore must not resolve, or a stolen
//!   session id would work forever.
