//! Applying migrations, and answering the only question a database can be asked about itself:
//! **which changes has it had?**
//!
//! Without this, "is the database up to date?" can only be guessed at, and a service can start
//! happily against a schema that is older than the code calling it — the failure then lands on the
//! first query, somewhere far from the cause.
//!
//! The record lives in `schema_version`, written *by each migration file itself* as its last
//! statement. That is deliberate: it means the `psql`-driven path (`tools/db-setup.ps1`,
//! `tools/m3-verify.ps1`) and this runner produce the same bookkeeping, and a migration applied by
//! hand is still recorded. The version is the file's number.
//!
//! Two properties make this safe to run any number of times:
//!
//! * every migration is idempotent (the repository's rule: `IF NOT EXISTS`, or `ON CONFLICT`), so
//!   re-applying one is a no-op;
//! * each migration is applied inside one transaction, so a failure part-way leaves neither the
//!   change nor the record of it. `tools/` use `psql -1` for the same reason.
