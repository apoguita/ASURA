//! Schema ownership and migrations.
//!
//! The rule this crate exists to enforce: **nothing outside this crate writes SQL.** Both services go
//! through functions here, so a schema change has one place to land and the translation from GWPS's
//! SQLite cannot leak into service code.
//!
//! AzerothCore parallel: their `DatabaseWorkerPool` plus per-database prepared statements. The
//! difference in shape is that their pools live inside each program; here the pool configuration is
//! ours and the statements are functions whose names say what they do.
//!
//! Vendor: PostgreSQL, a recorded deviation from AzerothCore's MySQL
//! (`docs/adr/0008-database-vendor.md`). The *structure* stays theirs; only the driver and the DDL
//! dialect differ, and both live behind this crate.
//!
//! ## What this database is for, and what is only passing through
//!
//! Two kinds of row live here, and they are leaving in different directions
//! (`docs/38-layer-decisions.md`, D20, D21, D23).
//!
//! **Operational state stays.** A row that changes while the server runs belongs here: `characters`,
//! `bag`, `item`, `session`, `account`, `transfer`, `lease`, `world`, `world_pool`, `service`,
//! `instance_unlock`, and the saved position. A character's gold changes while the server runs, and
//! nothing else may own that number.
//!
//! **Content is passing through.** A row that only *describes* the game will leave for a package
//! folder, where an author can copy and edit it without SQL: `map_config`, `map_spawn`, `map_portal`,
//! and the 214 `INSERT`s of map content inside migrations `0013`, `0014` and `0016`-`0022`. Until that
//! move is scheduled those tables are still how the world and the auth service read a map, so they
//! stay correct - but no new content row belongs in a migration. A new map is a row in `map_config`
//! only because the move has not happened yet.
//!
//! One sentence decides which side a new table is on: does the row change while the server runs? If
//! it does, it is state and stays. If it only describes the game, it is content and will move.
