//! Schema ownership and migrations.
//!
//! The rule this crate exists to enforce: **nothing outside this crate writes SQL.** Both services go
//! through functions here, so a schema change has one place to land and the translation from GWPS's
//! SQLite cannot leak into service code.
//!
//! AzerothCore parallel: their `DatabaseWorkerPool` plus per-database prepared statements. The
//! difference in shape is that their pools live inside each program; here the pool configuration is
//! ours and the statements are functions whose names say what they do.
//!
//! Vendor: PostgreSQL, a recorded deviation from AzerothCore's MySQL
//! (`docs/adr/0008-database-vendor.md`). The *structure* stays theirs; only the driver and the DDL
//! dialect differ, and both live behind this crate.
