//! Placement: registering a world, reserving a slot atomically, and keeping the lease ledger honest.
//!
//! Every statement that mutates `world`, `world_pool` or `lease` lives here. Callers (the auth
//! service, a world server, the fake-world harness) get functions whose names say what happens,
//! never SQL strings — the rule this crate exists to enforce (`src/lib.rs`).
//!
//! AzerothCore parallel: `realmlist` registration, the atomic realm/pool update, and the
//! `DatabaseWorkerPool`'s asynchronous write discipline. The shape is theirs; the vendor is
//! PostgreSQL (docs/adr/0008-database-vendor.md).
//!
//! The two invariants this module must never break:
//!
//! * **No oversell.** A reservation is one `UPDATE ... WHERE leased < capacity RETURNING`, so two
//!   processes cannot both take the last slot (`docs/02-architecture.md`, "Travel, end to end").
//! * **The ledger and the counter agree.** A lease row is inserted only after the counter increment
//!   won, and both are released or reaped in one transaction. `count(lease) <= leased <= capacity`
//!   therefore holds at every commit, which is what makes the reaper safe.
