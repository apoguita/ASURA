-- Travel portals as content (docs/32 Phase 1): one row per doorway, read by asura-world at start-up.
--
-- Every pre-Searing travel portal, from the game's own map data (Gw.dat), with a destination and a
-- landing point for each, so all of pre-Searing Ascalon can be walked through.
--
-- Where the rows come from:
--   * Positions, 24 of the 38: **our own** portal dump, `data/portals.json` - the prop of the portal
--     model (0xA825 = 43045) per map, read from the archive by `Map.Pathing.GetTravelPortals` through
--     Py4GW Stealth (`tools/gen-portal-table.py`, recorded 2026-10-31; `portal_at`/`portal_along` have
--     searched it since). Every coordinate below that appears in that file matches it exactly.
--   * Positions, the other 14: they do **not** appear in `data/portals.json`, which lists no prop at all
--     for map 160 or 161 and different props for 145 and 164. They were read instead from the pre-Searing
--     map blobs by model (0xA825 = 43045, and its twin mesh 0x858B = 34187): 113021 (Lakeside, Ascalon
--     City, Ashford Abbey), 116016 (Catacombs), 116025 (Northlands), 113190 (Green Hills, Barradin),
--     113355 (Wizard's Folly, Foible's Fair) and 113437 (Regent Valley, Fort Ranik). The server's path
--     graphs know these same maps under other blob ids (3806xx/3807xx) and return no door for 160/161, so
--     those 14 rest on a blob mapping this tree does not carry. Each says so in its own `source` column
--     as '[not in data/portals.json]', and the first live crossing of one replaces it.
--   * Destinations: a doorway between two maps is placed in both maps' blobs with the same height,
--     facing and scale, offset by a whole-tile shift. That shift is the same for every shared portal,
--     so the six blobs sit in one world frame (offsets from Lakeside: Green Hills +36864,+3072;
--     Northlands -6144,-30720; Wizard's Folly +24576,+39936; Regent Valley -21504,+36864; Catacombs
--     +30720,+9216, and 3700 lower). Each portal joins the maps whose blobs share it, checked against
--     the Guild Wars Wiki exit lists and against where the path graph is walkable.
--   * Landing points: the measured ones (live crossings, portals.rs CROSSED) wherever a crossing was
--     recorded; otherwise a walkable point 550-850 units inside the destination, clear of its
--     doorways (the same method lands within ~300-600 units of the measured points). Every landing
--     point is at least ~360 units from every arch of its map, outside portals::REACH (250).
--   * The arches are listed here; the measured crossing points stay where they are, in
--     `crates/asura-world/src/portals.rs` as `CROSSED`. This table is the compiled `PORTALS` half moved
--     into content, and the two are kept distinct (docs/32 work packages 2 and 5). Row numbers keep
--     their old values, so the gaps are where the merged-away rows were.
--
-- Rows marked 'derived' have not been walked yet: the first live crossing of each confirms or moves it.
-- The Catacombs blob also carries copies of the surface portals above it; only its own exits are listed.
-- Map 449 keeps its portal props without destinations (not pre-Searing).
--
-- ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING: re-applying the schema never overwrites an edited row.
