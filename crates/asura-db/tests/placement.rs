//! M2 acceptance tests: placement is safe under concurrency, and the reaper bounds a dead world.
//!
//! These tests run against the live PostgreSQL named by `ASURA_DATABASE_URL` (the environment, or the
//! repository's `.env`). They are harness-only: no game client, no protocol, no simulation — the point
//! of M2 is that placement can be trusted before anything client-facing exists (`docs/roadmap.md`).
//!
//! With no database configured a test prints a skip line and returns; `tools/m2-verify.ps1` is the
//! one-command way to run them for real.
