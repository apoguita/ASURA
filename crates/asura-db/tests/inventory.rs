//! M5 acceptance tests: a character's inventory and position survive a session.
//!
//! These run against the live PostgreSQL named by `ASURA_DATABASE_URL` (the environment, or the
//! repository's `.env`). Harness only: no game client, no sockets. What is proved is what the world
//! server asks the database for, and what it writes back:
//!
//! 1. a character with no bags is given the reference's default inventory -- six bags, nine items --
//!    and the *shape* of it is the capture's: the backpack carries its own item, two cupcakes sit in
//!    slots 0 and 1, and the equipment is in the equipped-items bag;
//! 2. seeding twice does nothing the second time, which is what makes it safe to run on every session
//!    (the reference's own `IsValidBag` guard);
//! 3. what is written reads back identical -- including a name that is not a string and a modifier list;
//! 4. a drop finds an item only in the bags the reference searches, and never in storage;
//! 5. a position written for a character reads back, and a character that has never been saved has no
//!    position at all rather than a coordinate at the origin.
//!
//! Every account name is unique per run (it carries a fresh UUID), so a run that panics before its
//! cleanup leaves an inert row that no later run can mistake for its own.
