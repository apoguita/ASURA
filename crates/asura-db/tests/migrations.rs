//! The database's own record of what it has had done to it.
//!
//! Runs against the live PostgreSQL named by `ASURA_DATABASE_URL` (the environment, or the
//! repository's `.env`), and skips cleanly without one.
//!
//! What this proves, and why it is worth a test rather than a comment: a record that is merely
//! written is not a record that can be *relied* on. The last test here takes a version away and
//! checks that the startup check notices, names what is missing, and that re-applying puts it back —
//! which is the whole point of keeping the record.
