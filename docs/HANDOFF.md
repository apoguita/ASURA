# Start here (session handoff)

State of the project as of the last commit, so a new session can begin without re-reading everything.

## Where this stands

- **M2 delivered: placement is safe, and it is proven against the real database.** The `asura-db`
  crate now owns registration, the atomic reservation, the lease ledger, the reaper and the
  reconciler; `asura-fakeworld` runs the whole sequence as a harness; the acceptance suite passes
  repeatedly (`.\tools\m2-verify.ps1`). No game client was involved — that was the point.
- **M1's scaffold still holds:** the workspace compiles, `cargo test --workspace` is green (16
  tests: 12 unit + 4 live-database placement tests that skip cleanly without a database), and
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` is clean.
- **Fifteen documents and eight ADRs** describe what is built, what is refused, and why.
- **GWPS is research material** (`docs/adr/0005-gwps-reference-only.md`). ASURA is written from
  scratch; nothing is ported or patched there.
- **AzerothCore is the design authority** for structure (`docs/adr/0006-azerothcore-is-the-reference.md`).
  A deviation has to be recorded before it is implemented — see ADR 0008 for how that is done well and
  how it is done badly.

## What M2 delivered

| piece | where |
|---|---|
| lease ledger migration (`lease` table: one row per reserved slot, unique per session) | `crates/asura-db/migrations/0002_leases.sql` |
| typed placement queries — register, heartbeat, reserve, release, reap, reconcile, remove | `crates/asura-db/src/placement.rs` |
| synchronous, idempotent migrations and the schema tests that keep them honest | `crates/asura-db/src/lib.rs` |
| the concurrency acceptance test (capacity N-1, N concurrent reservations, exactly N-1 win; full-pool refusal; reaper; reconcile) | `crates/asura-db/tests/placement.rs` |
| the fake-world harness (`asura-fakeworld scenario`) | `crates/asura-fakeworld/` |
| one command: integration tests + harness scenario | `tools/m2-verify.ps1` |
| dependencies, added with the code that needs them: `sqlx` 0.8 (PostgreSQL), `tokio` 1, `uuid` | `Cargo.toml` |

The acceptance result, verbatim from a run: capacity 4 with 5 concurrent reservations → 4 won, 1
refused; `leased` ends at capacity; the ledger matches; the reaper freed a silent world's leases and
left a fresh world's alone; reconcile rebuilt the counter from the ledger. Repeated 5×, no flakiness.

**Why a ledger beside the counter:** `world_pool.leased` makes the reservation atomic; the `lease`
rows make a lease *identifiable*, which is what the reaper needs to free a dead world's slots and the
reconciler needs to rebuild `leased` from the worlds instead of trusting the table
(`docs/05-gw2-lessons.md`, rule 2). They are inserted, released and reaped together in one
transaction, so `count(lease) <= leased <= capacity` holds at every commit and the
`world_pool_never_oversold` CHECK never fires.

## Environment status on this machine

| what | state | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | installed, 1.99.1 | `cargo test --workspace` → **16 tests, 0 failures**; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` → clean |
| cargo on PATH | **not** on PATH in a fresh shell | use `C:\Users\Apo\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe`, or add that directory to PATH permanently |
| **PostgreSQL** | installed, 16.15, service **Running**, and **provisioned** | role `asura`, database `asura`, **8 tables** applied (the 7 from 0001 plus `lease`); credentials in `.env` (gitignored) |
| psql | `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin\psql.exe` | not on PATH |
| client rig (Reforged + stealth hooks) | present from the PreSearing work | not needed until M4 |

**Database is ready.** `ASURA_DATABASE_URL` is in `.env` (gitignored, never committed). Both
migrations are applied; `crates/asura-db/tests/placement.rs` verified the pool invariants against the
live database — at capacity the reservation `UPDATE ... WHERE leased < capacity` returns no row (the
refusal signal), and an over-capacity row is rejected by `world_pool_never_oversold`.

If the superuser password is ever lost again, `tools/pg-recover.ps1` (run elevated) does the standard
recovery. It restores secure auth before it finishes, and it writes the new credentials to `.env`.

Setup in full:

```powershell
$env:PGPASSWORD = "<postgres superuser password>"
.\tools\db-setup.ps1            # creates role + database, applies every migration, lists the tables
```

Then prove M2 at any time:

```powershell
.\tools\m2-verify.ps1           # integration tests + the fake-world scenario, live database
```

(No network is needed for either once dependencies are cached. If `cargo` cannot reach crates.io,
the sandbox token may be blocking TLS — run it from a normal shell, or with full access.)

Scripts in this repository stay ASCII-only: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less file as ANSI,
where a UTF-8 em dash decodes to a smart quote and breaks the parse at a line far from the cause.

## Decisions already made (do not re-litigate without reading these)

| decision | where |
|---|---|
| **Rust** for the whole stack, translated from AzerothCore's structure | `docs/adr/0001-rust.md`, `docs/adr/0007-rust-translation.md` |
| **PostgreSQL**, a justified deviation from AzerothCore's MySQL; mechanisms unchanged | `docs/adr/0008-database-vendor.md` |
| Separate project from GWPS | `docs/adr/0002-separate-project.md` |
| Simulation is in scope, deferred behind the base structure | `docs/adr/0003-simulation-in-scope.md` |
| AzerothCore's server structure, adopted as a whole | `docs/adr/0004-port-azerothcore-structure.md` |
| GWPS is reference only; instance creation is settled by an experiment in this stack | `docs/adr/0005-gwps-reference-only.md` |
| AzerothCore is the design authority (structure); deviations are recorded | `docs/adr/0006-azerothcore-is-the-reference.md` |
| The one rule: never send a client to something that is not already answering | `docs/02-architecture.md` |

## Next session: M3 — the auth endpoint (the hard one)

Handshake, ARC4, DH with the fixed constants, login against the web gate, character list, character
select. The hard one, and the first that needs the real client. GWPS is the oracle for every byte
(`docs/03-protocol.md`), and `asura-protocol` already carries the message identities with the
`0x0099` size trap as a test.

1. **Verify the baseline** (2 minutes): `cargo test --workspace --offline` → 16 passing (4 skipped
   without a database). If the count changed, read `git log` before assuming it is broken.
2. **M3 — the auth endpoint.** Framing, the handshake, ARC4, DH with the fixed constants, login,
   character list. The risk is the opaque `007` client error, so the packet trace matters more than
   the code: keep `GWPS_TRACE`-style per-message logging from the first commit.
3. **M4 — end-to-end travel** stays blocked on M3 and on a world server that accepts its own
   gameplay connections (`docs/04-from-gwps.md`, step 1).

## Definition of done for the first session (met)

A `world` registered in the database, capacity published, reservations proven atomic under
concurrency, and the reaper proven to free a dead world's leases — all against the live database,
repeatedly, with no client, no protocol and no simulation. That is M2, and it is done.

## What is deliberately not here yet

- No networking, no client protocol. `tokio` and `sqlx` arrived with M2 because placement needed a
  database; the login socket does not exist yet.
- No CI. Tests run locally first.
- No simulation. It arrives in phase 2 (`docs/roadmap.md`).

## Reading order for a fresh session

`docs/HANDOFF.md` (this file) → `docs/01-scope.md` → `docs/02-architecture.md` →
`docs/03-protocol.md` → `docs/roadmap.md` → the ADR that matches the question you have.
`docs/00-glossary.md` defines every term if something reads as jargon.
