.SYNOPSIS
    Verify the login path: the schema, the identity pair, and the message table.

.DESCRIPTION
    Loads ASURA_DATABASE_URL from the environment, or from the repository's .env. Then runs:

      1. every pending migration (crates/asura-db/migrations/*.sql), applied in order. Idempotent, so
         this is safe to re-run and is how a database created before a migration catches up.
      2. the login integration tests (crates/asura-db/tests/login.rs):
         - a presented pair resolves to its account;
         - neither half of the pair is optional;
         - a closed session never resolves again, and re-seeding reopens it;
         - the newest session wins and the older one is closed;
         - a character list is scoped to its own account;
         - a character selection is recorded only on a live session.
      3. the protocol unit tests (crates/asura-protocol), including the check that every message in
         the generated table still computes to the size the GWPS reference declares.

    Harness-only: no game client. The client arrives once the handshake exists (docs/roadmap.md, M3).
