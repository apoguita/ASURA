.SYNOPSIS
    Verify the travel path: login, placement, and a character standing in a map.

.DESCRIPTION
    Loads ASURA_DATABASE_URL from the environment, or from the repository's .env. Then runs:

      1. every pending migration (crates/asura-db/migrations/*.sql), applied in order. Idempotent, so
         this is safe to re-run and is how a database created before a migration catches up.
      2. the dev identities and the maps (tools/seed-dev.ps1, tools/seed-map.ps1), because every test
         below needs a world and a map to place a player in.
      3. the protocol tests (crates/asura-protocol): the two message tables compute to the sizes the
         reference declares, the key exchange matches the reference's own fixtures, and the game
         builders produce the sizes the reference's send log records.
      4. the auth tests (crates/asura-auth): a client logs in over a socket, and a travel request is
         answered with a world that answers, or refused honestly.
      5. the world tests (crates/asura-world): a placed client is loaded into its map, a token nobody
         issued is closed silently, and — the one that matters — a client logs in to the auth service,
         travels, and reaches INSTANCE_LOAD_FINISH on the world server it was sent to.
      6. the generated files still match the reference: the auth table and the game table.

    Harness-only: no game client. The client arrives when you run tools/play.ps1.
