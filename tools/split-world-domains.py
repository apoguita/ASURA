"""One-off: split the world server's monolith into Stealth-shaped domain modules.

**Do not run this again.** It reads `lib.rs` as its input, and `lib.rs` is now the facade it
wrote. It ran once, on the pre-split file; the domain modules are the implementation from here
on. `tools/widen-world-visibility.py` is the second half of the move (the items need a
visibility once they live in different modules), and `tools/check-world-split.py` proves no
item was lost.

`crates/asura-world/src/lib.rs` held every domain at once. This moves each top-level
item to the file named after the game noun it belongs to, the way Py4GW_Stealth names
its classes, and leaves `lib.rs` as the facade: module list, re-exports, the crate
error, and the tests.

No line of code is rewritten: every item is moved as text, with the doc comments and
attributes that sit above it. The compiler and the test suite are what prove the move.

//!
//! The server's `Agent` - the counterpart of Py4GW_Stealth's `agent.py`, same noun, same
//! questions. The record is [`AgentState`] and [`Agents`] (below, moved here unchanged); a
//! player's placement is [`Standing`]; a walk is [`Walk`] and [`Motion`]; the movement trace
//! that a drift is diagnosed from lives at the bottom.
//!
//! What a client sends about its own agent, and what the server believes, is the reference's
//! rule set (`GmAgent.c`, `GameSrv_HandlePositionUpdate`): 50 units of slack, a 2-second
//! budget, a clamp instead of a drop. The doc comments on the functions say which.''' ,
    "player": '''//! The player: the character one connection drives, and the block that describes it.
//!
//! The server's `Player` - the counterpart of Py4GW_Stealth's `player.py`. [`player_block`] is
//! the character's own `GAME_SMSG_INSTANCE_PLAYER_DATA_*` run; the constants below are the
//! reference's defaults for it (`PLAYER_ID`, `AGENT_ID`, `PARTY_ID`) and the profession it
//! reports when a character row carries none.''' ,
    "map": '''//! The map: a catalogue entry, its path graph, and the blocks that carry it to a client.
//!
//! The server's `Map` - the counterpart of Py4GW_Stealth's `map.py`. [`MapEntry`] is what a
//! world publishes and what `/maps` lists; [`PathGraphs`] is the imported `Gw.dat` geometry a
//! `MOVE_TO_COORD` is answered from (the reference's `srv->map_context`); [`spawn_block`],
//! [`load_block`] and [`manifest`] are the map's side of the instance load.
//!
//! A live instance is **not** here yet: today the map a connection is in is a `MapEntry` on its
//! `Play` record (`connection.rs`). The instance object is the missing noun, recorded in
//! `docs/HANDOFF.md` and deferred with the simulation (`docs/adr/0003-simulation-in-scope.md`).''' ,
    "party": '''//! The party.
//!
//! The server's `Party` - the counterpart of Py4GW_Stealth's `party.py`. Nothing in this module
//! yet: the wire carries `PARTY_CREATE` / `PARTY_PLAYER_ADD` (built in `asura_protocol::game`),
//! and membership is implied by the peers standing in the same world (`world.rs`). The file
//! exists so the noun has a home before the first party rule does.''' ,
    "item": '''//! The item and the inventory: what a character carries, and what a client may do with it.
//!
//! The server's `Item` / `Inventory` - the counterparts of Py4GW_Stealth's `item.py` and
//! `inventory.py`. [`items_block`] and [`inventory_block`] are the load-time blocks; the four
//! client operations below are `DROP_ITEM`, `ITEM_MOVE`, `EQUIP_ITEM` and the refusal path, and
//! the row-level work is `asura_db::inventory`.
//!
//! [`move_item`] and [`equip_item`] are messages the reference does not dispatch at all - their
//! shapes are measured, not ported (`docs/HANDOFF.md`, M5).''' ,
    "chat": '''//! Chat: spoken lines, and the command table they arrive through.
//!
//! The reference has no chat handler; it prints and answers into its own log
//! (`docs/HANDOFF.md`). This module is that half, plus the `!`/`#`/`$` channel rule and the
//! `/maps`, `/stuck` and `/tp` command table ([`Command`], [`command`]) a player types into a
//! chat line. The travel `/tp` starts lives in `travel.rs`; this module only decides which
//! command a line names.''' ,
    "travel": '''//! Travel: leaving one instance for another.
//!
//! The reference's request/redirect cycle (`docs/02-architecture.md`, "Travel, end to end"):
//! reserve a slot, write a transfer row, send `TRANSFER_GAME_SERVER_INFO`, then
//! `MAP_UPDATE_CURRENT`. [`teleport`] is the `/tp` half; [`load_map_on_demand`] is the
//! documented fallback that loads a map this world was not started with (`docs/03-protocol.md`
//! #5c, measured 0-2 ms per map).
//!
//! The client-driven half of travel - `AUTH_CMSG_REQUEST_GAME_INSTANCE` and the front door - is
//! in `asura-auth`; a world only decides where a player *already here* goes next.''' ,
    "creation": '''//! Character creation: the instance and the choices a new character is made of.
//!
//! The reference's `MapType_CharacterCreation` - the only map type that is a conversation
//! rather than a place (`docs/HANDOFF.md`, M5). [`Creation`] is what a creation connection has
//! chosen so far; the two blocks are the reference's own default equipment and inventory for
//! that choice (`GetDefaultEquipments`, generated into `default_equipment.rs`).''' ,
    "connection": '''//! One gameplay connection: hello, load, play, goodbye.
//!
//! The server's `ConnectedClient` - the counterpart of Py4GW_Stealth's `client.py`. A socket is
//! classified, its key exchange is completed, the token pair is claimed against a transfer, the
//! load block goes out unasked, and then [`run`] owns the socket: the world tick, the ping, the
//! client's messages (through `dispatch.rs`) and the broadcasts other players push at it.
//!
//! [`Play`] is what one connection knows about itself, and it is where the map, the agents and
//! the inventory currently live. That is the shape the instance object would replace: the state
//! belongs to the map, not to the socket. Recorded, not fixed here.''' ,
    "dispatch": '''//! The dispatch table: one header in, one domain's handler out.
//!
//! The reference's `GameSrv.c` is one switch over headers and so is this; a client cannot be told
//! about a command seam it does not speak. What this file is *not*: a home for domain logic. Each
//! arm validates, then calls into `item`, `chat`, `travel`, `creation`, `player` or `map`; the
//! only state it touches is the one the message is about.
//!
//! A header with no arm is framed and ignored - named in the trace, never guessed at.''',
    "world": '''//! The world: the registry row, the maps it publishes, and everyone standing in it.
//!
//! [`World`] is what a world server registers as and what `serve` hands each connection. [`Peer`]
//! and [`Peers`] are the players in it: the reference's `srv->agents`/`srv->players`, kept here
//! because a connection's tick has to tell everyone else what it is doing.
//!
//! This is the noun the party and the instance both hang off; `docs/02-architecture.md` describes
//! the instance as a per-map update thread with affinity, and that object is still missing
//! (`docs/HANDOFF.md`, the world server's domains).''' ,
