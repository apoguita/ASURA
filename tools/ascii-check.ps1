# ascii-check.ps1 - fail if any source or document holds a non-ASCII byte.
#
# The rule is docs/HANDOFF.md, "The encoding rule: every file is ASCII". Windows PowerShell 5.1
# reads a BOM-less file as ANSI, so a UTF-8 em dash comes back as mojibake and the file is written
# back corrupted. ASCII is the one encoding every tool here agrees on, so it is checked.
#
# recordings/ is excluded on purpose: those files are bytes captured from a live client, evidence
# rather than writing. logs/, target/ and .git/ are not source. Binary extensions are skipped.
#
# Usage:  .\tools\ascii-check.ps1        exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = offender listed
