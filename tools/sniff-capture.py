"""Capture the live client's Guild Wars packets into a JSONL file.

Why this exists
---------------
A drift, a terrain jump, or a client that dies mid-load is not visible from the
server's own log alone: the server says what IT believes, and the capture says what
the client actually sent and received, with timings. Diffing the two -- and diffing
a capture of this server against a capture of the reference at the same spot -- is
how a movement or load problem is diagnosed instead of guessed at.

The sniffer itself lives in the client-side injection (Py4GW_Stealth). This script
is the front end: it says "capture for N seconds, from this client, into this file".
ASURA has no other dependency on that project; nothing is read from it at runtime.

Elevation is required, and not by choice
----------------------------------------
`py4gw.connect()` asserts an elevated token and refuses without one, because
connecting is a write -- shared block, dispatcher, handler entries. A process cannot
raise its own token, so:

    Start an elevated PowerShell (approve the UAC prompt), then run this script.

Running it unelevated prints the reason and exits 2.

32-bit only
-----------
The client rig patches the 32-bit client's threads and reads the instruction pointer
through the x86 ``CONTEXT``. A 64-bit interpreter sees a zero instruction pointer
from that client and the patcher refuses to write. So this tool is 32-bit only:

- started with a 64-bit interpreter, it re-executes itself under the 32-bit one
  (found via ``ASURA_PY32``, the standard per-user 32-bit 3.12/3.13 install, or
  ``py -3.13-32``);
- with no 32-bit interpreter available, it says so and exits 2;
- a 64-bit client is refused for the same reason.

`--self-test` needs neither a client nor elevation.

The log is a ring, so this drains it
------------------------------------
The client-side sniffer keeps a capped log and drops the oldest entry first. A long
session would therefore silently truncate itself. This script reads the log,
**clears it**, and repeats -- so the file is complete regardless of how long it runs.

Records are sanitised by default
--------------------------------
Captures contain UTF-16 player names and UUIDs, so a capture must be sanitised before
anyone shares it. This script therefore, by default:

  * replaces the payload of the 15 headers the sniffer itself names as carrying
    UTF-16 names with a marker, keeping `size`;
  * masks every run of printable UTF-16LE code units (>= 6) anywhere else, zeroing
    the bytes and recording the ranges in `masked`, so offsets stay meaningful.

`--raw` turns both off, keeps every byte, and prints a warning. A raw capture must
not be committed.

Usage
-----
    # both directions, 90 seconds, into a named file
    py tools/sniff-capture.py --seconds 90 --dir both --out recordings/client/feature/movement/movement-sniff-20260101-000000.jsonl

    # only the movement messages
    py tools/sniff-capture.py --seconds 60 --dir both --header 0x0029,0x002D,0x0030,0x803D,0x803E,0x8028

    # no client, no elevation: prove the sanitizer and the writer work
    py tools/sniff-capture.py --self-test

Exit codes: 0 captured (or self-test passed), 2 not elevated, 3 no client found,
4 capture failed.

This file stays ASCII-only, like every script in tools/ (docs/HANDOFF.md).
